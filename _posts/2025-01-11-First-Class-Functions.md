# First Class Functions

"A programming language is said to have first-class functions if it treats functions as **first-class citizens**." - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function).

## What Does It Mean for Functions to Be First-Class?

It means that they can be treated like any other object, such as integers or strings. In other words, functions:

1. **Can be assigned to variables.**
2. **Can be passed as arguments to other functions.**
3. **Can be returned from other functions.**

Let's explore these aspects in detail.

## Assigning Functions to Variables

Functions in Python can be assigned to variables just like any other object:

```python
# Defining a function
def square(x):
    return x * x

# Assigning square function to variable.
f = square

print(f) # output: <function square at 0x7c5aaf0b00e0>
print(square) # output:<function square at 0x7c5aaf0b00e0>

# calling the function
print(f(5)) # output: 25

```

## Passing Functions as Arguments

Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions.

```python
# Defining a function
def square(x):
    return x * x

# Defining a function which takes two arguments
def func_map(func, arg_list):# func=>square, arg_list=>[1,2,3,4,5]
    result = []
    for arg in arg_list:
        result.append(func(arg)) # func(arg) => square(arg)
    return result

# Passing a square function and list as an argument
squares = func_map(square, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

print(squares) # output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

## Returning Functions from Other Functions

Functions can also return other functions.

```python
# Defining a function that returns another function
def html_tag(tag):
    # Defining a wrap_text function inside html_tag function
    def wrap_text(msg):
        print(f"<{tag}>{msg}</{tag}>")
    return wrap_text # returning a function wrap_text

# passing argument 'h1' to html_tag function
f = html_tag('h1')

print(f)
# output: <function html_tag.<locals>.wrap_text at 0x7d511d884040>

f("Hi! my name is Shiva.") # output:<h1>Hi! my name is Shiva.</h1>
f("I live in Nepal.") # output:<h1>I live in Nepal.</h1>

```

## Use Cases for First-Class Functions

1. **Functional Programming**: Functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` leverage first-class functions to enable concise functional-style operations.
2. **Callbacks**: Pass functions as arguments for event-driven programming.
3. **Dynamic Behavior**: Generate functions dynamically or return specialized functions based on input conditions.

## Conclusion

The concept of first-class functions is fundamental in Python, enabling powerful and flexible code structures. By understanding and leveraging this concept, you can write more efficient and elegant Python programs.

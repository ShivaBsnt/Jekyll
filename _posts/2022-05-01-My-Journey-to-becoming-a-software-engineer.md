I always had in the back of my mind, how to become a software engineer, how to write programs, how can one land such jobs. Am I qualified enough? What root or path should I take? Am I going in the right direction? I questioned myself almost every single day. Being an IT student, I had the technical knowledge, I knew about coding but not enough to land me a job.  Although I did some projects throughout academics, I knew that I lacked the skills, vision, and mentorship to pursue my interest and establish myself as a backend developer.

Luckily, I got to know about the Insight Workshop boot camp. Its academy program and course were exactly what I was looking for. It was not just a course, it was an opportunity, indeed a golden opportunity to take a leap toward my dream and turn it into reality. Due to the pandemic, the onsite academy was not possible but still, they managed to pull an online academy and left no stone unturned to provide the student with mentorship and technical education. The course was fruitful and I enjoyed a process where I was learning something new, exciting, and skills of great value every day. It was really fun where dots were getting connected and then the contents were making more sense. Overall, it helped me to bridge the technical gap and pave my road toward software engineer. It provided me with all the technical and professional skills, enough to start a software engineer career. The best part about boot camp was getting an opportunity to connect and learn from professionals and meet the other tech enthusiast with the same amount of hunger.

After completing the academy, I was fortunate enough to get the position of the trainee in Insight Workshop. I had mixed feelings on the first day and was quite nervous but the Insight workshop family was kind and generous enough to provide me warm welcome and comfort. Within three months of the trainee phase, I learned to work on a team, use different development tools, got introduced to different project management techniques, and got a chance to work on real projects. All thanks to mentors, seniors, and the Insight Workshop team who helped me to continuously grow and now establish myself as a full-time software engineer. It is one of the best things that ever happened to me. I always thought that the software engineer will be dead serious about work, they got no time to breathe, they do not laugh, they work and work and work. But Insight Workshop family proved that the developers can be so full of life, happy, full of laughter, kind, welcoming, and hardworking at the same time.
